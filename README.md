# CSMA-CD

Implementation of Carrier Sensing Multiple Access protocol in Matlab with collision detection (exponential back-off algorithm) to transfer packets between 4 pair of nodes in the network

Using Dijkstra’s routing protocol to choose the shortest path across routers to destination node

The performance parameters used for evaluation – access, queueing delay, throughput, number of collisions and efficiency with respect to change in slot-time and inter-arrival time of packets for simulation time of 30 seconds
